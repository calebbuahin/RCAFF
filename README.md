This work was conducted as part of the National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE) summer institute held at the National Water Center on the University of Alabama Campus, in Tuscaloosa from June 1st to July 17th, 2015. The goal of the experiment was to investigate approaches for conducting real-time, high spatial resolution, hydrologic modeling over the entire nation using open and interoperable frameworks for improved emergency response and community resilience. We wish to express our gratitude to the organizers of the institute including the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Weather Service (NOAA-NWS) and their federal partners for their financial support as well as the cyberinfrasture and datasets they provided during the course of the summer institute.
